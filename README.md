## PROBLEM:-
Ever thought how is the life of a blind person, their life is full of risk. They can't even walk alone through a busy street or through a park. They shall need some assistance from others. They are also curious about the beauty of the world. Even though they can find their own things without anyone's need. So, How we solve this?

## SOLUTION:-
#### We are introducing:  iSpecs 

Simply, iSpecs is a pair of smart glasses for the blind. By using iSpecs, a person can able to know what is going on in front of him.  
User can able to talk to google assistant for any assistance also he or she can able to control their home automation systems using google assistant at the same time he or she can able listen to music entertainment via google play music.
  
## WORKING:-
iSpecs does have three main parts, a raspberry pi 3 (powered by android things), camera and a button. When the person press the button on the iSpecs, The iSpecs will take a picture and analyze the image using tensor flow and detect what is that picture is about, then using a speaker or headphone, the iSpecs will voice assist the person about that picture.
This is how iSpecs works.

## Concept Design:-
  Many visually impaired peoples out there, expecting some kind of thing that can help them to be self-reliable themselves.
  So, we would like to bring this concept into reality. We designed a couple of concept design in a 3D modeling CAD tool.
 We have also integrated Google assistant so that user can able to use google assistant for their home automation systems and can also able to play awesome music on the go using google play music. 

## POWER CONSUMPTION:-
 The Raspberry Pi 3 is powered by a +5.1V micro USB supply. The maximum power the Raspberry Pi can use is 1 Amp. If you need to connect a USB device that will take the power requirements above 1 Amp, then you must connect it to an externally powered USB hub.
